# NextJS blog learning project

This is just a personal learning project from an old dog who wants to learn some new tricks, nothing terribly exciting to see here.

This is based on a starter template for [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn).

using eslint config from [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58233482/next-js-setting-up-eslint-for-nextjs/61160352#61160352)

uses `gray-matter` for parsing markdown front-matter headers.

uses `remark`, `remark-html` for parsing markdown.

uses `date-fns` for date functions.
